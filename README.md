Welcome to Struc-Bench! We employ the same finetune.py and generate.py as used in alpaca-lora. Moreover, we have divided generate.py into three distinct categories: table, html, and latex. The scoring results can be found in the score directory, with scores derived from GPT housed in the gpt_score subdirectory. The remaining evaluations are segregated into table_scores.py, html_scores.py, and latex_scores.py, respectively.


## How to use generate.py
You can use the command:
```
python generate.py read_json_path output_file_path
```
For example:
```
python generate.py "table_test.json" "table_test_output.txt"
```
